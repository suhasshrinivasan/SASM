SIC Assembler

So I've been interested in systems programming and tried my hand in writing a primitive assembler for the SIC architecture. Illustrates basic functioning of assemblers with minimal error checking. 
It's a 2 pass assembler. Generates addresses for instructions in the first pass and generates object codes with the object program in the 2nd pass.
The code is neatly commented for the sake of readability.
